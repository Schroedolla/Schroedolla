- 👋 Hi, I’m @Schroedolla (aka Caden Schroeder)
- 👀 I’m interested in using code to help finish projects I have in the future. Currently, I am a big C family fan (C, C++, C#),
   and I hope to further my skills in these languages to expand my coding horizons.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about string libraries and printing emails to different files in strings through a ciphering project.
  I hope to learn about linked lists, trees, graphs, and classes next.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a project on designing an electric motor, as I am very interested in coding for robotics.
- 📫 You can reach me by cell my email cadenscores@gmail.com or linkedin https://www.linkedin.com/in/thecadenschroeder
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: C is my favorite coding language, but I one day hope to build its successor (Tera).
